# Modular-steering-wheel-hub
This repo is for a simple modular steering wheel originally designed for a lawn mower. 

All that you need for this project is a 3D printer, some filament, and some M3 bolts.

To install, print the hub to a desired height (I stopped mine early, to the height of the splines on the steering shaft). Heat the steering shaft with a propane torch (Butane may work as well), and carefully press the clamp and hub onto the hot steering shaft. Allow it to cool to form a perfect fit. Simply screw/bolt in the steering wheel into the hub and start working!

Note that the clamp doesn't offer much much strength anywhere. It may help with literaly about 1% of the torque with steering, and it may help stabilize the hub a bit, but it realistically doesn't offer much. If you choose to use it, opt for a few longer bolts in the top three holes and only attach the clamp through them. The idea would be to allow the print to flex a bit to work correctly as a C clamp. 

Images for reference. 

BECAUSE OF AN ERROR IN FUSION, YOU MAY HAVE TO SCALE THIS DOWN TO 10% IN YOUR SLICER!
